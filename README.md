## Objective.
Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents.
## Description.
Instagram museums, they’re arts and culture installations like you’ve never seen before. “Instagram museums” set out their main objective in their name: be as Instagrammable as possible, often at the expense of expected museum norms such as… exhibitions. Where many museums in the past have discouraged or outright banned photography, these venues actively encourage taking as many photos as you like and – most importantly – posting them to social media, particularly Instagram.Despite the moniker of “Instagram museum“, they’re often far more comparable to art installations. They tend to focus more on looking good – both in real life and on your phone screen – and relegate educational aspects to a secondary concern.
